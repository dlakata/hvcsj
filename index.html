            <p>The HVCSJ is a non-profit organization, and here's our mission statement.</p>

            <h5>Mission Statement:</h5>

            <p>
            The purpose of the HVCSJ is to provide an opportunity for students from Grade Kindergarten to 12th  grade to learn chess and to improve their skills in chess, and to compete in tournaments against other players.
            </p>

            <h5>Narrative Description:</h5>

            <p>
            In the past, the HVCSJ has provided chess instruction, chess drills, and US Chess Federation-rated chess tournaments to its members. The HVCSJ has also organized is members into teams to participate in local and regional USCF chess tournaments. The chess instruction had included inviting top chess masters to give lectures to our club members.
            </p>

            <p>
            Currently, the HVCSJ continues to provide chess instruction, chess drills, and USCF rated tournaments to its players. In addition, to organizing its members into club teams, the current activities have been expanded to the point where the HVCSJ also organizes its members into teams by individual school in order to compete for school team trophies at local and regional USCF rated tournaments. Also, the HVCSJ now encourages its high school members to earn community and school volunteer hours by instructing other club members in the advanced skills of chess. The HVCSJ also participates in community fairs in which the HVCSJ operated an oversized chess set and invites members of the local community to learn about the game of chess.
            </p>

            <p>
            The HVCSJ plans to continue all its current activities and to expand its activities by organizing chess matches against other clubs. In addition, the HVCSJ plans to monitor the location of national tournaments and to send its members to national tournaments whenever possible.
